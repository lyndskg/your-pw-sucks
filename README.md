## Project Overview 

`your-pw-sucks` is a a comprehensive password analysis program that evaluates the strength and security of user-provided passwords. 

The program aims to empower users to create stronger, more secure passwords by providing detailed feedback and recommendations based on industry best practices and advanced analysis algorithms.

&nbsp;

---------------------

<a name="obj"></a>
### <ins>Key Objectives</ins>:

1. __<ins>User Interface Development</ins>:__
> - Design and implement an intuitive and user-friendly interface using a graphical user interface (GUI) framework like `PyQt` or `Tkinter`.
> - Include input fields for users to enter passwords and customizable options for adjusting analysis settings (e.g., minimum length, character requirements).
> - Display analysis results in a clear and understandable format, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the password.
2. **<ins>Password Strength Metrics</ins>:**
> - Implement algorithms to assess various aspects of password strength, including:
>> - Length: Ensure passwords meet a minimum length requirement (configurable by the user).
>> - Character Diversity: Check for the presence of different character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) and assess their distribution.
>> - Avoidance of Common Patterns: Detect common patterns, sequences, or dictionary words in passwords that could make them vulnerable to attacks.
>> - Entropy Calculation: Calculate the entropy of passwords to estimate their randomness and unpredictability.
>> - Common Substitution Patterns: Identify and penalize passwords that use common character substitutions to create the illusion of complexity.
>> - Repetition and Sequential Characters: Detect and flag repeated characters, consecutive numbers, or sequential keyboard patterns in passwords.
>> - Check Against Known Breached Passwords: Compare passwords against known breached password lists to warn users if their password has been compromised.
>> - Custom Rules and Policies: Allow users to define custom password strength rules and policies based on their specific security requirements.
3. **<ins>Integration with Password Crackers</ins>:**
> - Integrate password-cracking libraries or tools (e.g., `John the Ripper`) to simulate real-world password cracking attempts.
> - Analyze crack results to provide insights into the effectiveness of the password and its susceptibility to common attack methods.
> - Utilize the results to provide tailored feedback and recommendations for improving password security.
4. **<ins>Feedback and Reporting</ins>:**
> - Provide detailed feedback to users on the strength and security of their passwords, highlighting areas for improvement.
> - Generate comprehensive reports summarizing the analysis results, including metrics such as password complexity score, entropy, and vulnerability assessment.
> - Offer actionable recommendations and best practices for creating stronger, more resilient passwords.
5. **<ins>Security and Privacy</ins>:**
> - Implement robust security measures to protect user passwords and analysis results, including encryption and secure storage practices.
> - Ensure compliance with privacy regulations and standards to safeguard user data and maintain user trust.
6. **<ins>Customization and Configuration</ins>:**
> - Allow users to customize analysis settings and thresholds to align with their specific security needs and preferences.
> - Provide options for adjusting sensitivity levels and trade-offs between security and usability, accommodating users with varying levels of security expertise.
7.**<ins>Documentation and Testing</ins>:**
> - Create comprehensive documentation, including installation guides, user manuals, and API references.
> - Conduct thorough testing across different operating systems, environments, and use cases to ensure the program's reliability, accuracy, and performance.
> - Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and ensure the timely delivery of updates and improvements.
